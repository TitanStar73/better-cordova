# Common Issues

> Directory not empty: The directory must be empty to run the script (This is a cordova thing). Reference the python script or binary from outside. You can do this by
>   - Referencing the script/binary's absolute path
>   - Adding the script/binary to PATH

> It can also be accessed using a bat file with the following command (assuming the script is main.py and is in the same folder)
```python "main.py" new %PluginType% %ProjectName% %DisplayName% %Author% %Description% %Confirm%```
